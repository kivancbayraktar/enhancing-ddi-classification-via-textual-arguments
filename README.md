# Enhancing DDI Classification via Textual Arguments

This repository contains the implementation for our paper:

**"Enhancing Drug-Drug Interaction Classification by Leveraging Textual Drug Arguments"** (2025)

## üìÑ Overview

This study proposes a novel method for Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) classification that leverages textual arguments extracted from **DrugBank**, going beyond traditional approaches that primarily rely on molecular or chemical features.

It explores the impact of integrating **text embeddings** and **text-based similarity matrices** alongside existing chemical properties. To achieve this, drug-related types and concepts extracted from the **Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)**, as well as identified entities, were used to construct similarity matrices as additional input features.

The effect of these textual features was assessed through a series of experiments using various implementation scenarios with a **deep neural network** model.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Generate `drugbank.db`

Use the DrugBank parser and processor to build a local SQLite database (`drugbank.db`) that contains both textual and structured drug-related data.

> **Note:** In this work, **DrugBank v5.1.10** was used and processed.  
> You must download the full DrugBank XML file from [DrugBank's official website](https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest) (requires a free academic license). Place the XML file in the appropriate input folder before running the parser.

### 2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

The NER step identifies drug mentions in biomedical texts:

- **Preferred**: Load the pre-generated NER results from the provided `.pkl` file.
- **Optional**: To generate NER outputs from scratch:
  - Ensure [Apache cTAKES](https://ctakes.apache.org/) is installed and running.
  - Execute [NER processor](run_ner.py) to process raw text and produce the output.

### 3. Textual Drug Embeddings

Text embeddings were generated for textual features of drugs found in DrugBank columns such as **description**, **interactions**, and **indications**.

You can either:

- Download the **precomputed text embeddings** from the link below for quick setup:
üì• **Download from Kaggle**: [DrugBank Text Embeddings (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kivancbayraktar/0295501b-e673-43e9-af91-7d06ec21cb7d)

- or generate your own embeddings using pre-trained models compatible with Sentence Transformer.

### 4. Run Experiments

To run all of the experiments were carried out of this study, please run [Experiments](colab_notebooks/experiments.ipynb.ipynb).To switch between experiments you should change `experiment_configuration_file`. All experiments can be follow using [MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org).
